# LemonadeStand

A Java project to practice using primitive variables while simulating a lemonade stand business.

## Project Description

LemonadeStand is a simple program that mimics the operations of running a lemonade stand. Students will use various primitive variables in Java to manage inventory, sales, and profits.

## Learning Objectives

- Practice using integer variables for inventory and sales counts
- Utilize double variables for prices and money calculations
- Apply boolean variables for business decisions
- Implement char variables for menu options

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE
3. Navigate to the `LemonadeStand.java` file
4. Complete the TODO comments in the code

## Tasks

1. Declare and initialize variables for:
   - Lemons in stock (int)
   - Cups of sugar in stock (int)
   - Empty cups in stock (int)
   - Price per cup of lemonade (double)
   - Money in cash box (double)
   - Is the stand open? (boolean)
   - Today's special flavor (char)

2. Implement methods to:
   - Make lemonade (decrease inventory)
   - Sell lemonade (increase money, decrease inventory)
   - Restock supplies (increase inventory, decrease money)
   - Calculate daily profit

3. Use conditional statements to check inventory levels and make business decisions

## Submission

Complete all TODO items in the `LemonadeStand.java` file and submit your work according to your instructor's guidelines.

## Additional Challenge

Implement a simple menu system using `switch` statements and the `char` variable for flavor selection.

Good luck and happy coding!
